# ExpressJS Boilerplate - Project Setup
## Purpose
- A personalized ExpressJS boilerplate reduced from the code used to build the 
[Exploratory Project](https://github.com/troveofgems/express/tree/main/exploratoryProject).

Files in this folder demonstrate an ExpressJS web-server implementation.
ExpressJS is a package that sits atop of NodeJS. NodeJS can accomplish the same tasks as express,
however, express makes the job of managing routes and middleware far simpler.

Steps To Use
- `git clone https://github.com/troveofgems/express.git`
- `cd express_boiler`
- `mv ./env.txt ./.env` - Then manually configure any variables as needed
- `node desiredCommand`
- `Open URL http://localhost:PORT`

**Note**: This boiler has been integrated into the [TTOG MERN Boilerplate](https://github.com/troveofgems/ttog_mern_boiler)
