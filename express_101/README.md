# ExpressJS 101 - Project Setup
## Purpose
- Demonstrates the creation of an express server and the management of basic routing and serving static files.

Files in this folder demonstrate an ExpressJS web-server implementation.
ExpressJS is a package that sits atop of NodeJS. NodeJS can accomplish the same tasks as express,
however, express makes the job of managing routes and middleware far simpler.

Steps To Demo
- `git clone https://github.com/troveofgems/express.git`
- `cd express_101`
- `node nodeServer`
- `Open URL http://localhost:PORT`

# What is Express & Why Should I Care?

To start, you cannot have Express without NodeJS.
Express is a web framework for NodeJS that eases the process of creating web elements that allow your application to
be built quickly. Used for routing and middleware.

It is a third party package. Remember to check the github page but otherwise the command is:

`yarn add express`;
